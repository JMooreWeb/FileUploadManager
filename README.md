# ASP.NET MVC 5 File Upload Manager

This is my first Github repository!

When looking for a nice solution to handle file uploads, I came across a jQuery File Upload plugin which has a great user experience feel to it. When I read the summary down below it stated it works with any server-side platform. I was kinda shocked not to see ASP.NET as an example since its one of the most popular server-side scripting language used today. Was ASP.NET intentionally left out on purpose? Hmmm...

File Upload widget with multiple file selection, drag&drop support, progress bar, validation and preview images, audio and video for jQuery. Supports cross-domain, chunked and resumable file uploads. Works with any server-side platform (**ASP.NET**, PHP, Python, Google App Engine, Ruby on Rails, Java, etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads.

For this project, I'm currently using Visual Studio 2015, .NET Framework 4.6, ASP.NET C#, MVC 5, Web API 2.
